Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a security architecture for LinuxÂ® systems that allows administrators to have more control over who can access the system. It was originally developed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) as a series of patches to the Linux kernel using Linux Security Modules (LSM).
* overview  of Selnux security 
SELinux (Security Enhanced Linux) is an implementation of a Mandatory Access Control permission system (MAC) in the Linux kernel. This type of access control differs from Discretionary Access Control systems (DAC) like ACLs and standard unix ugo/rwx permissions, in how the access to a resource is provided

* SELinux has three modes:
     Enforcing: SELinux policy is enforced. SELinux denies access based on SELinux policy rules.
Permissive: SELinux policy is not enforced. SELinux does not deny access, but denials are logged for actions that would have been denied if running in enforcing mode.
Disabled: SELinux is disabled.

* Commands for enforcing mode 
   Open the /etc/selinux/config file in a text editor of your choice, for example: # vi /etc/selinux/config.
Configure the SELINUX=enforcing option: # This file controls the state of SELinux on the system. # ...
Save the change, and restart the system: # reboot.

* enable 
  We need to change the status of the service in the /etc/selinux/config file. ...
You are now able to change the mode of SELinux to either enforcing or permissive. ...
Next press CTRL + X to save changes and exit the edit mode. ...
To reboot enter: sudo reboot.
